This is a simple and **entertaining** game where you just have to combine 3,4,5 fruits with theirself.

# Rules
Rules are simple you have amount of moves and you have to complete the mission before 0 move to win
if you dont do it before you lose!.

I have fun coding it so enjoy it here: [PLAY](https://louislam09.github.io/CombineFruits/)
